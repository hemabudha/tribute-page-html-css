            <h1>Achievements</h1>
            
            <p>Tata Group began when JRD Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons in 1991 and Ratan Tata was chosen as his successor.
                He convinced Tata Tea to buy Tetley, Tata Motors to buy Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel to buy Corus, transforming it from a mostly Indian concern into a multinational firm.
                He also designed the Tata Nano vehicle. The car’s price was designed to be affordable for the Indian buyer.
                In 2008, Tata set up one of the largest philanthropic organizations in India, the Tata Trusts. In the same year, Tata was awarded the Padma Vibhusan for his national service.
                During his 21-year tenure, the revenue increased more than 40 times and the profit increased more than 50 times.
                The success story of Ratan Tata took a turn when in 2012, on his 75th birthday, he retired as chairman of the Tata Group.</p>
